Snippets
========

This repository contains only personal snippets of code for me to remember and easily find for later reuse. It's not a full Solution or Project, may not even be all the same programming language, nor is any of the code expected to run or compile on it's own. If you, by luck or fate, stumble onto something you find useful here, feel free to reuse it per the terms of The Unlicense. For more information, see <http://unlicense.org/>.
